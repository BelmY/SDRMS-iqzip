 32 bits vs. 64 bits
---------------------

libaec compiles and runs both in 32 and 64 bits. For encoding and
decoding I see a performance degradation with 32 bit binaries of 38%
and 33% resp.

The main reason for this is that encoding and decoding use a buffer of
type uin64_t to align a potentially 32 bit wide sample with the output
(encoding) or input (decoding) stream. Avoiding the use of this
uin64_t buffer variable would degrade 64 bit performance for a modest
gain in 32 bit performance so I decided against it.
